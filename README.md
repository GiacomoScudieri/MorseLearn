# MorseLearn
We are a team of two developers and we are creating a website thanks to wich you can easily learn Morse code and test your knowledge and memory.
We feature a variety of gamemodes and minigames such as:

-🎓Learn mode, where every newcomer should start their journey.
-🥊Practice mode, an offline mode where you test your skills by typing a short text in morse.
-🏁Race mode, similiar to Typeracer, you play against 3 other players; the first to finish the race wins!
